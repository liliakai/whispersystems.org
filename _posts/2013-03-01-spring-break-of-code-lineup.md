title: "Blog >> SBoC Lineup"
layout: post
---

We were excited about our [Spring Break Of Code announcement](/blog/spring-break-of-code/), but the response 
was better than we anticipated: over 100 extremely impressive proposals from folks around the world who are 
passionate about pushing the envelope of security and privacy software.  After reading all the proposals, we 
really wish we'd rented a bigger house. 

We think the final lineup of accepted proposals is great:

XXXXX

<img alt="Christine Corbett" src="/blog/images/christine-sboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Christine Corbett** ([@corbett](https://twitter.com/corbett)) I'm an MIT educated software engineer with several prominent 
iOS/Android apps (CircleOf6, Encyclopedia) in both the non-profit and for-profit sectors. I'll be working on an iOS TextSecure 
integration plan (with prototype) and lending my hand to RedPhone wherever possible.

I'm a huge productivity and project management geek which will also come in handy as we manage the balance between surfing 
the internet/waves and getting things done.

**Rhodey** Engineer in my early 20's, interested in most everything, with a strong bias for space, hacking, music, and sailing. 
Plans to spend SBoC developing software which allows cellphones to determine whether their environment is friendly or hostile 
and react accordingly. I also hope to spend some time looking into adding a data-based (non-SMS) channel to TextSecure.

<img alt="Lilia" src="/blog/images/lilia-sboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Lilia** I'm a software developer, occasional hardware hacker, and yoyoer from San Francisco. I'll be helping people 
understand the whys and hows of secure communications by building out app documentation and on-boarding information.

<img alt="Tyler" src="/blog/images/tyler-sboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Tyler Reinhard** ([@abolishme](https://twitter.com/abolishme)) It's hard to know how to describe Tyler's work, but 
we know he's done the following: lectured on design and social critique throughout Scandinavia; co-owned and operated 
a hand-composition letterpress studio; typeset a newspaper written in the Lakota language; survived a quarter-year of 
work as *Chef Garde Manger* behind the pass of a [AAA 3-Diamond fine-dining restaurant](http://signatureswinona.com/) 
with no prior professional kitchen experience; appeared as a "critical theorist" in a cultural documentary called 
[Twilight of the Mississippi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH_DskTuDlA); collaborated on an international hoax that 
nearly gave [Glenn Beck a heart attack on-air](http://www.glennbeck.com/2011/04/18/something-missing-from-the-office-friday-was-national-steal-from-work-day/); lost a tooth in a work-related crowbar accident; and published a 7,000-word essay for a 
comprehensive note-taking methodology called [Semantic Notes](http://semanot.es/).

<img alt="Calder" src="/blog/images/calder-sboc.png" class="nice-left"/>
**Calder Coalson** I'm a Chicago native and junior CS major at Carleton College in Minnesota.  I enjoy programming things, 
exercising free speech, pranking people, centrifuges, airplanes, sailing, xkcd, board games, space, cats, space cats, wait, 
what's a space cat? I'm dying to work on designing a more intuitive and (yes) *fun* identity system.

<img alt="Isis Lovecruft" src="/blog/images/isis-sboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Isis Lovecruft** ([@isislovecruft](https://twitter.com/isislovecruft))  I'm in my early twenties. I do lots of things 
and wander to lots of places. I double majored in Theoretical Physics, and English Literature, with a specialisation 
in Feminist Critical Theory. I'm highly interested in cryptography and network security, and I occasionally provide 
workshops and lectures on digital security topics for free to activist groups.  It's hard to know how to classify my 
software development work, but the one unifying theme across all of my efforts is my overwhelming love for the Java 
programming language. At Spring Break Of Code I'll be working on improving group messaging support in TextSecure.

<img alt="Andy Isaacson" src="/blog/images/andy-sboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Andy Isaacson** ([@eqe](https://twitter.com/eqe)) is a kernel hacker and distributed systems implementor interested in 
security and individual freedom.  He co-founded Noisebridge hackerspace in SF and helps run Noisetor, the Tor Exit Node
operated by Noisebridge.  At SBoC he'll be implementing multi-master database reliability for the RedPhone server backend 
and fixing some nagging documentation bugs.
