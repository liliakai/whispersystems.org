*A guest post by [Christine](https://twitter.com/corbett). Spring Break Of Code, Day Four*

The main sound on top of the ocean is the click clack of laptop keys,
and the jangle of test calls and SMSes. A neighbor stopped by to
comment that we must be the next Facebook, the next Google; working
instead of surfing made sense in his mind only in the land of money at
the end of the tunnel. He loaned us his stand up paddle boards, surely
expecting a return on investment 10 fold down the line when we exited
into the sunset. A journalist visiting Open Whisper Systems' Spring
Break of Code commented that she expected more philosophy, politics,
and conversation. After all this group is composed of people who are
not only technologists, but also open source evangelists, activists,
and humanists. [Lilia](/blog/streamlining-textsecure-settings/) went over 
some of the *why*, but practically anyone
could see we were concentrating on the *how*, and in the frenzied silence
it was clear that a common philosophy was assumed and what bound us
here was the challenges in the technology to power that philosophy.

[Rhodey](/blog/highly-unconventional-suggested-first-aid/) and 
[Isis](/blog/dirigibles-chinese-junk-rigs-and-surfboards/) 
shared their meeting [Moxie](http://www.thoughtcrime.org) stories. I'll go a bit
further and trace back time, as we go farther back. I first met Moxie
in a crowded hotel room in New York City around 2004, a place to crash
between sessions at a hacker conference, huddled in a circle
discussing things entirely new to me. Some time later I saw him on the
West coast, he was living in a hand-built houseboat, from recycled
material, off the coast of the San Francisco Bay. In Boston, he
stopped by my makerspace warehouse of a home for a few evenings when
he was in the area to screen his [documentary](http://vimeo.com/15351476) about his sailing from
the coast of Florida to the Caribbean. He pulled up in a vegetable-oil-powered
VW truckbed, and driving around we couldn't help but smell
french fries in the fumes.

Back in San Francisco, I had begun my hobbyist career in mobile
application development, and taken the summer off from my PhD to
concentrate on a successful [offline Wikipedia client](http://steamheavyindustries.com), and a
thusfar-failed [micro video messaging service](http://www.kliq.tv/), both for iOS.
Frequenting the makerspace Noisebridge, Moxie was already hard at
work on Whisper Systems' apps, both for Android. One day he announced
he would be heading to Arizona to pick up a hot air balloon he had
purchased on the cheap with the goal of air delivering it back to his
San Francisco home. Convinced he might be in over his head, I tried to
dissuade him. Never fear, he would receive a free lesson from the
owner, and air currents and water currents weren't all that different.
A captain of the seas could also captain the skies. I wasn't
convinced, but Moxie made the journey.

Given this history, when Moxie wrote me "Want to come to Hawaii for a
week, to hack?", I didn't have to ask what for, when or why to
immediately reply "sure". Back in my home of Zurich, Switzerland, I
had transitioned to apps for social good -- Circle of 6](http://circleof6app.com), an anti sexual
assault app being the flagship -- and had formed a non-profit, Tech for
Good, to spearhead them. I knew anything Moxie was up to would fit in,
technically and philosophically with my personal missions. On arrival
to Hawaii, it likewise came as no surprise to me that Moxie
Marlinspike had curated a technically stellar and necessarily diverse
group. The network went down due to a wayward Bitcoin trading AI. We
learned about notation for juggling patterns, the preferred sport of
anarchists (soccer anyone?), and conversed about whether ideology
should serve people, people ideology, and what ideology choosing
between the two options would entail. We surfed, dined, and even
discussed politics to the delight of the journalist.

This week I've been working on the iOS version of TextSecure. I've had
a delightful time, and plenty of lessons I've learned from my other
projects have been more than useful. It's extremely helpful to have
Moxie working on the data channel backend and Tyler working on design
by my side. We already have a [Github project](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure-iOS) 
for the repository, and a
bare bones prototype with user authentication and sending a simple
message working. I have been working on the backend cryptography,
integrating OpenSSL, and preparing for the end-to-end prototype by the
end of the week. Here are a few teasers:
