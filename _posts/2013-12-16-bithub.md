At Open WhisperSystems, we often get emails from people who'd like to donate money to the project.  For an OSS project, 
particularly one that aspires to a collective sense of ownership, handling donations is not always entirely straightforward.

The fundamental contradiction is that while donations are meant for a *project*, they're traditionally sent to a *person*.
Even if a project sets up a bank account, there are still only a few people who have access to the money itself, and 
distributing it appropriately can be hard to figure out.

Its never been clear to us how we should handle small donations, so oftentimes when people ask about donating, we just tell
them that the best way to help is to use the software, spread the word, and file well-documented bugs when they find them.  Which
is true!  But it'd also be great if we had a nice system for handling donations that matched our objectives for collective ownership.

## A Bitcoin Experiment

We've written and deployed a [simple service](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/BitHub) called "BitHub" that does two things:

1. Accepts Bitcoin donations and allocates them into a single pool of funds.
1. Distributes the Bitcoin donations from that pool to *anyone* who commits to our repositories.

We're starting with an initial "worse is better" distribution strategy: the owner of every merged pull request is
paid 2% of our total balance at the time of the merge.  Depending on how that works, we might adjust the payout strategy
in the future, or even add features like the ability to donate for bounties on specific GitHub [issues](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues).

In order to effectively communicate the current payout for a project to developers, a BitHub instance will render the current
payout amount (in USD) as an image that can be embedded in a GitHub project's README.md (or anywhere).  

For example, this is the current Open WhisperSystems payout per commit, rendered dynamically as an image by the Open 
WhisperSystems BitHub instance:

<img src="https://bithub.herokuapp.com/v1/status/payment/commit?format=png"/>

A project's BitHub instance will also return JSON (or rendered HTML) of the most recent payouts.  For example, these are the
five most recent Open WhisperSystems payouts returned from the API:

<iframe seamless="true" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="250px" frameBorder="0" src="https://bithub.herokuapp.com/v1/status/transactions"> </iframe>

This way anyone can donate to the project, and the donations are distributed to anyone who'd like to be involved in the project.

## We've got Bitcoin! We need Bitcoin!

If you'd like to help the development of Free and Open Source privacy software that is attempting to 
[advance the state of the art](/blog/advanced-ratcheting) for secure communication and also 
[reduce the friction required](/blog/cyanogen-integration) for ordinary people to make use of it, you can 
submit Bitcoin donations here:

<a class="coinbase-button" data-code="d29fd4c37ca442393e32fdcb95304701" data-button-style="donation_large" href="https://coinbase.com/checkouts/d29fd4c37ca442393e32fdcb95304701">Donate Bitcoins</a>

<script src="https://coinbase.com/assets/button.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>

Anyone will be able to use your donation to contribute time to Open WhisperSystems projects, and you can watch the commits
that your donation is paid out on.

If you'd like to commit code to Free and Open Source privacy software, commits to these repositories are currently paying
<span class="bithub-payout-amount"><code>loading...</code></span> from our BitHub instance:

<script type="text/javascript">
 var xml = new XMLHttpRequest();
 xml.open("GET", "https://bithub.herokuapp.com/v1/status/payment/commit?format=json", true);

 xml.onreadystatechange = function() {
   if (xml.readyState != 4)  { return; }

   document.getElementsByClassName("bithub-payout-amount")[0].innerHTML = "<code>$" + JSON.parse(xml.responseText).payment + " USD</code>";
 };

 xml.send(null);
</script>

## Try It Yourself

The BitHub project is itself open source and available for [anyone to deploy themselves](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/BitHub).

It should be extremely easy to configure and deploy, and it even pays out for commits to itself!

This was inspired by the [tip4commit](http://tip4commit.com) prototype, which we saw last week.  We thought the idea was great,
and wanted anyone to be able to host a system like that themselves.
